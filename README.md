## System Requirements
- macOS or UNIX, the code was developed on macOS Big Sur 11.7
- [R](https://www.r-project.org/) version >= 4.1.2


## Installation 
A ```yml``` file is provided and can be used to build a conda virtual environment containing all R dependencies. Create the environment using:
```bash
$ cd phyloflows
$ conda env create -f phyloflows.yml
```
Then activate the environment for use:
```bash
$ source activate phyloflows
```

## Usage
### The files in ```src/```
The scripts in ```src/``` read the identifiable individual-level data, de-identifiable and aggregate them, and save them in ```data/```. 

### The files in ```misc/```
The scripts in ```misc/``` read the aggregated data and fit smoothing models to obtain hiv prevalence, art coverage and viral suppression for participants and first-time participants by age, gender and round.
* Obtain smooth hiv prevalence by age, gender and round with file ```get_estimates_prevalence.R```
* Obtain smooth art coverage in participants by age, gender and round with file ```get_estimates_art_coverage_participants.R```
* Obtain smooth art coverage in first-time participants by age, gender and round with file ```get_estimates_art_coverage_non_participants.R```
* Obtain smooth viral suppression in participants by age, gender and round with file ```get_estimates_unsuppressed_proportion_participants.R```
* Obtain smooth viral suppression in first-time participants by age, gender and round with file ```get_estimates_unsuppressed_proportion_non_participants.R```
* Combine art coverage and viral suppression estimates to obtain treatment cascade in participants with file ```get_treatment_cascade_participants.R```
* Combine art coverage and viral suppression estimates to obtain treatment cascade in first-time participants with file ```get_treatment_cascade_non_participants.R```
* Combine art coverage and viral suppression estimates to obtain treatment cascade in population with file ```get_treatment_cascade_population.R```

### Run the incidence rates analysis
To run the age-specific HIV incidence rates analysis, run in the console 
```bash
INDIR="/rds/general/user/mm3218/home/git/phyloflows"
OUTDIR="/rds/general/user/mm3218/home/projects/2021/phyloflows"
Rscript scripts/run_incidence_rates_estimation.R --indir=$INDIR --outdir==$OUTDIR
```

### Run the transmission flows analysis
We provide a bash shell script that can be run on a laptop. The following modifications need to be done to the start of the bash script ```run_stan_laptop.sh```. First, set the the directory in which the repository is located, and the output directory where the results should be stored in lines XYZ:
```bash
INDIR="/rds/general/user/mm3218/home/git/phyloflows"
OUTDIR="/rds/general/user/mm3218/home/projects/2021/phyloflows"
```
Second, set as appropriatly your virtual environment in lines XYZ: 
```bash
module load anaconda3/personal
```

You can then execute the bash script. Run on the terminal console from the repository directory
```bash
./run_stan_laptop.sh
```
This generates in the output directory two bash scripts. One for running the model and one for processing the results. Execute these bash scripts one after the other.
